== Overview

Implementations of OGC API Standards provide Web based capabilities which are typically based on polling for collection resource updates (new features/records items, coverages, maps, etc.). Depending on a collection’s temporal resolution or frequency of updates, an event-driven / Publish-Subscribe architecture provides a timely, efficient and low latency approach for delivery of data resource updates.

The following requirements and recommendations apply to Publish-Subscribe architectural patterns for use with implementations of OGC API Standards.

The Publish-Subscribe architecture assumes reasonable connectivity or favorable DDIL conditions. https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/denied_disrupted_intermittent_and_limited_impact[DDIL] refers to Denied, Disrupted, Intermittent, or Limited communications.

== Use cases

Numerous use cases exist for event driven architecture and Publish-Subscribe workflows in OGC APIs:

- OGC API - Common: new collections: a data publisher making their data available as a collection via an OGC API wishes to advertise a new dataset publication
- OGC API - Features: a client wishes subscribe to data granule inserts, updates or deletes from a feature collection

- OGC API - Records: a client wishes to subscribe to metadata updates from a given metadata repository.  Instead of traditional polling (for the last 24 hours of updates, for example), real-time notifications are sent whenever metadata record is added, updated or deleted
- OGC API - Processes: a wishes to execute a long running process.  Instead of polling for job status updates, the user can subscribe to a Pub/Sub broker to receive status updates in real-time.
- OGC API - Processes: a user subscribed to real-time notifications of synoptic weather observations loses their connection for 6 hours.  A custom process allows for a user to specify a time range, area of interest, and topic(s), as well as a subscriber id to be used as part of a callback which is configured before executing the process (user subscription to their "replay" topic).  When the proces executes, the server immediately responds via HTTP with Pub/Sub connection details, and via Pub/Sub, returns notifications based on the user query inputs.  This use case is similar to a typical OGC API - Features request/response, but the difference is being able to use Pub/Sub workflow as part of the response.
- OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval: Earth System Prediction model run and data granules notifications: A given numerical weather prediction system produces a weather forecast as part of a model run.  A model run typically has associated forecast hours.  Each forecast hour makes available one or many weather elements at different pressure levels of the atmosphere.  For example, Canada's Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS) produces two model runs per day, providing forecast of numerous weather elements for 33 pressure levels, at a resolution of 15 kilometres.footnote:[https://eccc-msc.github.io/open-data/msc-data/nwp_gdps/readme_gdps_en].  A Pub/Sub workflow can be applied to an NWP system where a) notifications are sent as individual weather elements (data granules) become available and b) notifications are sent once the model run generation is complete, or "fully qualified"

As a result, as an event driven design pattern, Pub/Sub eliminates the need for continuous polling while a model run is in progress.

== Channels

The OGC API service endpoint specified by a URL path of resources and sub-resources can be used in parallel as a channel description when the data publisher wishes to provide Pub/Sub capability for resources normally available via an OGC API implementations instance in the same way. Below are examples of service endpoints or resources normally available via HTTP, and how they can be reused as topics for Pub/Sub workflow:

- ``/collections``: Notifies Subscribers whenever there is a change to the ``/collections`` resource (for example, addition of a new collection). The message payload would be collection metadata as defined in the https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#collection-description[OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial Data candidate Standard], or a message referencing the collection metadata.

- ``/collections/{collectionId}``: Notifies Subscribers whenever there is an update to a single `collection` resource (for example, spatial or temporal extents, new items, etc.). The message payload would be defined by either the resource model of the given collection (items, etc.), or a notification message of metadata referencing the collection with the relevant change.

For example, users could use a subscription to metadata records, which are usually small compared to the source data, and are therefore more transportable. This informs and notifies the user of changes prior to requesting the possibly large source data, especially when bandwidth is at a premium.

Using the OGC API service endpoints of the URL path of resource and sub-resources provides the key benefit that developers implementing OGC API Standards do not need to learn a different, additional approach or resource path for Pub/Sub (same content, additional interface).

=== Providing notification metadata from an OGC API endpoint

For brokers providing notification metadata (as opposed to actual data or record payloads), an implementation of OGC API Building Blocks can, in parallel, provide GeoJSON based notification messages via (for example) an OGC API — Features or OGC API - Records endpoint. Providing message payloads via an OGC API provides the additional benefit of querying for messages over time in case of a lost connection.
