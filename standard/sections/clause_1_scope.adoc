== Scope

The OGC API - Publish-Subscribe Workflow - Part 1: Core Standard defines building blocks that can be assembled to implement Publish-Subscribe workflows (discovery, topic structure, encoding) as part of OGC API Standards.

This Standard defines a discovery capability that contains a topic structure in support of binding to notifications for data access and retrieval.

This Standard also defines baseline message payloads which can contain summary descriptive information about a given notification for new data events (new granule, new model run, etc.).
